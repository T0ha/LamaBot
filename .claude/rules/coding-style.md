## Coding Style

- Use `with` as much as possible for flow control
- Use pipe operator (|>) for chaining
- Prefer simple functions with patterns matching over complex ones
- Limit line length to 80 characters
- Prefer case statements for multi-branch conditionals
- Always create typespecs for public functions but avoid `any()` and `term()` types when possible
- Use descriptive function names with ? suffix for boolean functions

- Use `@doc` and `@moduledoc` for inline documentation
